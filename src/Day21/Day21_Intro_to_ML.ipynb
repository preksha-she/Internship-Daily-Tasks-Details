        "Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed with fixed rules. In traditional programming, developers write specific instructions, and the computer follows those rules to process input data and generate output. In contrast, Machine Learning systems are given large amounts of data along with the correct answers, and they automatically identify patterns, relationships, and trends within that data. Instead of hardcoding every possible scenario, the system builds a model that can make predictions or decisions when exposed to new, unseen data. This makes Machine Learning powerful for solving complex real-world problems such as recommendation systems, image recognition, fraud detection, and predictive analytics."
