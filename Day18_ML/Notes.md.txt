# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Regression
Used when target variable is continuous.
Example: House price prediction.

## Classification
Used when target variable is categorical.
Example: Spam detection.

## Train-Test Split
Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

## Evaluation Metrics for Regression
- MAE
- MSE
- R2 Score
